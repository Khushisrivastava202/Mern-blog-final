              Welcome to my Blog! This blog was created by Khushi Srivastava
              as a personal project to share my thoughts and ideas with the
              everyone.As a passionate final-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree 
              in Computer Science, I am driven by a curiosity to explore and master the world
              of technology, coding, and everything in between.
              My focus lies in becoming a proficient MERN stack developer,
              with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development,
               and this blog website is one of my best projects on MERN stack.

              On this blog, you'll find weekly articles and tutorials on topics
              such as web development, software engineering, and programming
              languages. I always learn and explore new
              technologies, so be sure to check back often for new content!
